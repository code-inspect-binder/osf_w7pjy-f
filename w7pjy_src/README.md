This repository contains an autonomous R package that can be downloaded as zip file and installed from within R by `devtools::install_local("path_to_zipfile")`.

All required analysis scripts to reproduce the results and output in the accompanying paper live in `scripts/`. The data files used for the analysis are already located in the correct paths (i.e., in `data/` and `output/`), no adjustments are required when running the scripts. All methods developed for this paper are coded as functions and can be found in `R/`.
